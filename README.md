## Before Proceeding
Ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed. This project uses various packages from the langchain ecosystem, along with additional dependencies for loading documents, handling embeddings, and creating a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using langchain components. The pipeline loads web documents, converts them into a vector database, and uses a language model to answer questions based on the retrieved information.

## Dataset
The data used in this project is sourced from specific URLs. The documents are loaded using WebBaseLoader and then split into smaller chunks for processing.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves splitting the loaded documents into smaller chunks using a text splitter. This is necessary for efficient vectorization and retrieval.

## Model Building
The model building process involves several steps:

## Loading documents from the web.
Splitting the documents into smaller chunks.
Converting the chunks into a vector database using ObjectBox and OpenAIEmbeddings.
Model Evaluation
Model evaluation is not explicitly covered in this project. The focus is on setting up the RAG pipeline and retrieving answers to questions based on the provided documents.

## Inference
Inference is performed by creating a RAG pipeline. The pipeline uses a pre-defined prompt template and a language model (gpt-3.5-turbo) to generate answers based on the retrieved documents.

## Saving the Model
Saving the model is not applicable in this context. The focus is on creating and using a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline.
